The data available from the course website is used as the raw data. All the processing that was done on the data is part of the run_analysis.R script. No additional processing was done.

The scripts expects an unzipped directory "UCI HAR Dataset" to be present in the current directory.

The data in "Inertial Signals/" directory of train and test are not required for the purposes of "tidy" data and hence are not touched during the cleaning process.
